HOW TO CUSTOMISE
**************************************************

IMAGES

On the theme homepage (mac-host.com/slidingdoor) you can find the original photoshop files so you can edit the text on the sliding images and the background pictures to suit your own site. You need to upload the finished pictures to: themes/slidingdoor/imagemenu/images

IMAGE URL's

The images by default point to the first 7 wordpress categories. You can change this to point them wherever you wish, but you will need to edit the header.php file. The URL for the first image is in line 47 of the header.php file.  Line 48 contains the link for the second image and so on. 

SITE HEADING

The theme has the ability to have two colours in the blog heading. To use this optional effect you simply need to place square brackets around any words that you want to be darker. For example on my site I have as the blog name "free[wordpress]theme[!]" so the "wordpress" and "!" is darker. This does not effect the page title where the brackets are replaced by spaces.

DESCRIPTION
**************************************************

I found an effect I really liked at phatfusion.com and aaronbirchphotography, which is called image menu. I created a wordpress theme round it called sliding doors.

I also pinched some nice features from Michael Whalan's Elixir theme at whalesalad.com, namely the little comment about how long since the post was made and the groovy search box.
